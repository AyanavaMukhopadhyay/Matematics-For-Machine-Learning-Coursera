    "As you learned in the lectures, eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a very important role in what's called (discrete) dynamical systems. As you might recall, a **discrete dynamical system** describes a system where, as time goes by, the state changes according to some process. When defining this dynamical systems you could represent all the possible states, such as sunny, rainy or cloudy, in a vector called the **state vector**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each discrete dynamical system can be represented by a transition matrix $P$, which indicates, given a particular state, what are the chances or probabilities of moving to each of the other states. This means the element $(2,1)$ of the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $2$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Starting with an initial state $X_0$, the transition to the next state $X_1$ is a linear transformation defined by the transition matrix $P$: $X_1=PX_0$. That leads to $X_2=PX_1=P^2X_0$, $X_3=P^3X_0$, and so on. This implies that $X_t=PX_{t-1}$ for $t=0,1,2,3,\\ldots$. In other words, we can keep multiplying by `P` to move from one state to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of discrete dynamical systems is to model browsing web pages. Web pages often contain links to other pages, so the dynamical system would model how a user goes from one page to another by hopping from link to link. For simplicity, assume that the browser is only following links to a new page rather than navigating to an unlinked one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the state vector $X_t$ will be the probabilities that the browser is on a particular page at time $t$. Navigation from one page to another advances the model from one state vector $X_{t-1}$ to another state vector $X_t$. A linear transformation, defined by a matrix $P$, will have entries $p_{ij}$ with the probabilities that the browser navigates to page $j$ from page $i$. For fixed column $j$, the entries represent a probability distribution describing location of the browser at the next step, given that you are at state $j$. Thus, the entries in each column must add to 1."

    "Now you are all set to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "Due to performance constaints, you will not be using `np.linalg.eig`, but rather the very similar function [`scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html), which exploits the fact that $\\mathrm{cov\\_matrix}^T=\\mathrm{cov\\_matrix}$. Also, this function allows you to compute fewer number of eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is outside of the scope of this course, but it can be shown that at most 55 eigenvalues of `cov_matrix` will be different from zero, which is the smallest dimension of the data matrix `X`. Thus, for computational efficiency, you will only be computing the first biggest 55 eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_{55}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $v_1, \\ldots, v_{55}$. Feel free to try changing the `k` parameter in `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh` to something slightly bigger, to verify that all the new eigenvalues are zero. Try to keep it below 80, otherwise it will take too long to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of this scipy function are exactly the same as the ones from `np.linalg.eig`, except eigenvalues are ordered in decreasing order, so if you want to check out the largest eigenvalue you need to look into the last position of the vector. \n"

Notice that you can't make any combination you like, if you reduced the original data to just $k$ components, then the recovery must consider only the first $k$ eigenvectors, otherwise you will not be able to perfrom the matrix multiplication.\n",

As you might remember from the lectures, the goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality by projecting data in the directions with biggest variability. \n",

    "In practical terms, the explained variance of a principal component is the ratio between its associated eigenvalue and the sum of all the eigenvalues. So, for our example, if you want the explained variance of the first principal component you will need to do $\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{55} \\lambda_i}$\n",

    "Next, let's plot the explained variance of each of the 55 principal components, or eigenvectors.
